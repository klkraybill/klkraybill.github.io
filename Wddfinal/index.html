		<!-- info 1 -->
		<div class="alarm-text">Lonley people have much higher illness rates becaues when they're not around other humans (and thus their bacteria and such) their inflammatory systems becomes more sensitive to outisde microbes.</div>
		<!-- info 2 -->
		<div class="neuron-text">The vagus nerve is intimately tied to how we connect with one another. It links directly to nerves that tune our ears to human speech and coordinate eye contact. Studies have found that higher vagal tone is associated with greater altruistic behavior.

		<!-- info 3 -->
		<div class="ball-text">There is research that proves the more basketball team members touche eachother the higher the score.
		</div>
		<!-- info 4 -->
		<div class="money-text">Social anthropology theorizes that money and status decreases functions of happiness because when one does not need things from others, they do not need to connect. This circles back to overactive immune system idea.

	<div class="pill-text">There was a study where people with emotional pain took tylenol (acetaminophen) and reported fewer hurt feelings during that period. Brains scaled at end of treatment and the acetaminophen takers had less activation in those 2 brain areas.
